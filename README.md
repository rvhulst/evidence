# evidence
Site of the R-package evidence for Bayesian statistical inference.

The functions in this package include Bayesian and likelihood
equivalents of the standard statistical hypothesis tests that form part
of base R. Their aim is to provide a wider perspective on how statistical
evidence can be analyzed than the usual frequentist approaches. In view
of the increasing importance in science of Bayesian and likelihood
inference an early exposure to these alternatives has become overdue.

This package makes Bayesian and likelihood analyses of simple statistical
problems as convenient as traditional frequentist ones are in R. In
addition, it makes effective use of R's excellent plotting capabilities,
and facilitates exploratory data analysis and an interactive approach to
modeling. Both data exploration and model exploration are crucial in
data analysis, and these are facillitated by an interactive and graphics
centered approach.
